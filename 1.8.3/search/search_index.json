The main difference from the typesafe client is that while the typesafe client behaves like a typesafe proxy very similar to the MicroProfile REST Client, the dynamic client is more like the JAX-RS client from the javax.ws.rs.client package. Instead of working with model classes directly, the dynamic client focuses on programmatically working with GraphQL documents representing GraphQL requests and responses. It still offers the option to convert between documents and model classes when necessary. In the current implementation, Vert.x HTTP client is used for handling the underlying traffic. Creating a client instance Generally there are two ways to obtain a client instance. First, using CDI injection where the configuration values are defined in system properties: @Inject @GraphQLClient ( \"superheroes\" ) DynamicGraphQLClient client ; // assuming that this system property exists: // superheroes/mp-graphql/url=https://superheroes.org/graphql The above example assumes that configuration for the client is present in system properties. For a full list of supported configuration properties, see Client configuration reference The other way to build a client is programmatically using a builder: DynamicGraphQLClient client = DynamicGraphQLClientBuilder . newBuilder () . url ( \"https://superheroes.org/graphql\" ) . build (); The usage examples in the following sections will assume using the first approach - injection. Basic Usage Given the following GraphQL service on the server side: @GraphQLApi class SuperHeroesApi { @Query List < SuperHero > allHeroesIn ( String location ) { // .... } } class SuperHero { private String name ; private List < String > superPowers ; } Such service can be queried this way: package examples.dynamicclient ; import examples.typesafeclient.SuperHero ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.GraphQLClient ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.Response ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Document ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.dynamic.api.DynamicGraphQLClient ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import javax.json.JsonArray ; import java.util.List ; import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException ; import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Argument.arg ; import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Argument.args ; import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Document.document ; import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Field.field ; import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Operation.operation ; public class MyClientUsage { @Inject @GraphQLClient ( \"superHeroes\" ) DynamicGraphQLClient client ; public void execute () throws ExecutionException , InterruptedException { Document document = document ( // <1> operation ( field ( \"allHeroesIn\" , args ( arg ( \"location\" , \"Outer Space\" )), field ( \"name\" ), field ( \"superPowers\" )))); Response response = client . executeSync ( document ); // <2> JsonArray heroesArray = response . getData (). getJsonArray ( \"allHeroesIn\" ); // <3> List < SuperHero > heroes = response . getList ( SuperHero . class , \"allHeroesIn\" ); // <4> } } <1> Creating the document representing the request. We used static imports to make the code easy to read, they all come from the classes in the io.smallrye.graphql.client.core package. <2> Executing the request. You can either do that in a blocking way, or request a Uni if you prefer the reactive style. <3> Obtaining the resulting list of heroes as a JsonArray . <4> Obtaining the resulting list of heroes as instances of the model class. This is optional, you can continue working with the data as a JsonArray if you prefer. Using plain strings instead of the DSL If you don't like the DSL for some reason and want to use plain strings for your queries, these two examples will serve you: package examples.dynamicclient ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.GraphQLClient ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.Response ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.dynamic.api.DynamicGraphQLClient ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import java.util.HashMap ; import java.util.Map ; import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException ; public class MyClientUsageString { @Inject @GraphQLClient ( \"superheroes\" ) DynamicGraphQLClient client ; public void execute () throws ExecutionException , InterruptedException { String queryWithInlineVariables = // <1> \"query {\" + \" allHeroesIn(location: \\\"Outer Space\\\") {\" + \" name\" + \" superPowers\" + \" }\" + \"}\" ; Response response = client . executeSync ( queryWithInlineVariables ); String queryWithExtractedVariables = // <2> \"query($loc: String) {\" + \" allHeroesIn(location: $loc) {\" + \" name\" + \" superPowers\" + \" }\" + \"}\" ; Map < String , Object > variables = new HashMap <> (); // <3> variables . put ( \"loc\" , \"Outer Space\" ); Response response2 = client . executeSync ( queryWithExtractedVariables , variables ); } } <1>: In this variant, we inline values for query arguments directly into the query string. <2>: In this variant, argument values are extracted into variables. The location argument of the allHeroesIn query is declared to be using the variable loc (the variable can also be named location same as the argument, if you prefer). <3>: Here we create a map that defines the values for each variable. Values of this map are Object s, so you can put in strings, numbers, booleans, or any object that corresponds to a GraphQL type and can be serialized to JSON. Inserting a JsonObject directly is also supported. Accessing HTTP headers and response codes To access HTTP transport metadata that was passed by the server, you can inspect the Response object. Response.getTransportMeta(\"HEADER-NAME\") returns a List<String> containing (potentially multiple) values of the requested header.

Basic Usage Creating the client-side counterpart of the GraphQL API: package examples.typesafeclient ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.typesafe.api.GraphQLClientApi ; import java.util.List ; @GraphQLClientApi public interface SuperHeroesApi { List < SuperHero > allHeroesIn ( String location ); } A model class: package examples.typesafeclient ; import java.util.List ; public class SuperHero { private String name ; private List < String > superPowers ; // plus getters and setters } Injecting the client using CDI and using it: package examples.typesafeclient ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import java.util.List ; public class MyClientUsage { @Inject SuperHeroesApi superHeroesApi ; public void execute () { List < SuperHero > allHeroes = superHeroesApi . allHeroesIn ( \"Outer Space\" ); // ... } } The default request type is query . To make it a mutation, annotate it @Mutation . The parameter name is only available if you compile the source with the -parameters option. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to annotate all parameters with @Name . The example above uses CDI, e.g. when you are in a MicroProfile or Jakarta EE environment. If you are in an environment without CDI support, you need to instantiate the API interface by using the builder: SuperHeroesApi api = TypesafeGraphQLClientBuilder . newBuilder (). build ( SuperHeroesApi . class ); The basic idea of the Java code-first approach is that you start by writing the DTOs and query/mutation methods as you need them in your client. This ensures that you don\u2019t request fields that you don\u2019t need; the thinking is inspired by Consumer Driven Contracts . If the server uses names different from yours, you can simply use annotations to do a mapping: Name Mapping / Aliases If the server defines a different field or parameter name, annotate it with @Name . If the server defines a different query name, annotate the method as, e.g., @Query(\"findHeroesCurrentlyLocatedIn\") . By renaming methods, you can also define several variations of the same request but using different return types or parameters. E.g.: public interface SuperHeroesApi { SuperHero findHeroByName ( String name ); @Query ( \"findHeroByName\" ) SuperHeroWithTeams findHeroWithTeamsByName ( String name ); } The SuperHero class has no team affiliations (for this example). The SuperHeroWithTeams class has a List<Team> teamAffiliations field. The actual query name is still findHeroByName . The Team class doesn\u2019t contain the members to break recursion. If you rename a field or method, the real field or method name will be used as an alias, so you can select the same data twice (see and below). Configuration If the endpoint is always the same, e.g. a public API of a cloud service, you can add the URL to your API annotation, e.g.: @GraphQLClientApi ( endpoint = \"https://superheroes.org/graphql\" ) interface SuperHeroesApi { } When instantiating the API with the builder, you can set (or overwrite) the endpoint there: SuperHeroesApi api = TypesafeGraphQLClientBuilder . newBuilder () . endpoint ( \"https://superheroes.org/graphql\" ) . build ( SuperHeroesApi . class ); Commonly you\u2019ll need different endpoints, e.g. when you need one endpoint for your production system, but a different endpoint for your test system. Simply use MicroProfile Config to set the endpoint; similar to the MicroProfile Rest Client , the key for the endpoint is the fully qualified name of the api interface, plus /mp-graphql/url , e.g.: org.superheroes.SuperHeroesApi/mp-graphql/url = https://superheroes.org/graphql If you want to use a different key, set the base config key on the annotation @GraphQLClientApi(configKey = \"superheroes\") ; then use this key for the endpoint superheroes/mp-graphql/url . When using the builder, you can override the config key as well: TypesafeGraphQLClientBuilder.newBuilder().configKey(\"superheroes\") . NestedParameter Some APIs require parameters beyond the root level, e.g. for filtering or paginating nested lists. Say you have a schema like this: type Query { team(name: String!): Team! } type Team { members(first: Int!): [SuperHero!]! } To pass the parameter to the nested field/method, annotate it as @NestedParameter , e.g.: @GraphQLClientApi interface TeamsApi { Team team ( String name , @NestedParameter ( \"members\" ) int first ); } The value of the @NestedParameter annotation is the dot-delimited path to the nested field/method that the value should be added to.","title":"Basic usage"},{"location":"typesafe-client-usage/#basic-usage","text":"Creating the client-side counterpart of the GraphQL API: package examples.typesafeclient ; import io.smallrye.graphql.client.typesafe.api.GraphQLClientApi ; import java.util.List ; @GraphQLClientApi public interface SuperHeroesApi { List < SuperHero > allHeroesIn ( String location ); } A model class: package examples.typesafeclient ; import java.util.List ; public class SuperHero { private String name ; private List < String > superPowers ; // plus getters and setters } Injecting the client using CDI and using it: package examples.typesafeclient ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import java.util.List ; public class MyClientUsage { @Inject SuperHeroesApi superHeroesApi ; public void execute () { List < SuperHero > allHeroes = superHeroesApi . allHeroesIn ( \"Outer Space\" ); // ... } } The default request type is query .

Say you have a schema like this: type Query { team(name: String!): Team! } type Team { members(first: Int!): [SuperHero!]! } To pass the parameter to the nested field/method, annotate it as @NestedParameter , e.g.: @GraphQLClientApi interface TeamsApi { Team team ( String name , @NestedParameter ( \"members\" ) int first ); } The value of the @NestedParameter annotation is the dot-delimited path to the nested field/method that the value should be added to.","title":"NestedParameter"},{"location":"using-smallrye-stork/","text":"Using SmallRye Stork SmallRye GraphQL client (both dynamic and typesafe) supports SmallRye Stork for service discovery and load balancing. If your client is configured to connect to a URI with the stork:// or storks:// scheme, then Stork will be used to determine the actual endpoints to connect to.
